(Edit as needed) After the meeting today we have decided on pursuing the following topics:
1. Spin scooter trend predictions
2. Volcanoes
3. Aquifer table
4. Anything with a map

Our goal here is to cumulate the data sets needed to make the suitable predictions. 
The order is from top to lowest priority. 
If we find the top priority will not form a feasable project, let's switch to the next highest priority

This is a test
