    -   fort-collins-curb-events-deployments.csv

    -   fort-collins-curb-events-trip_starts.csv

    -   fort-collins-curb-events-trip_ends.csv

-   City of Fort Collins Website

The graphs contain normalized data of roads/line segments in Fort Collins and the count of matched trips taken over that price period.

Wanted to examine this further, but ran into problems.

The data for the actual number of rides ends October 17th 2024, so there isn't a lot to compare.
