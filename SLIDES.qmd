## Spin E-Scooters!

## Research Question

This research examines the declining performance of Spin scooters in Fort Collins through a multi-faceted analysis of ridership patterns, pricing impacts, and deployment efficiency.

We use forecasting models to analyze ride frequency trends, coupled with counterfactual analysis of Q2 price changes, and KNN-based spatial distribution modeling.

Our findings predict a negative trend in scooter rides, and suggests opportunities for optimizing both pricing strategy and scooter deployment to better align with Fort Collins' usage patterns.

## Examining the Data

::: r-fit-text
Our data was provided for by three different sources, and as such, there were a lot of different formats for the data we worked with and options for the project

-   Fort Collins Transportation Planner

    -   fort-collins-curb-events-deployments.csv

    -   fort-collins-curb-events-trip_starts.csv

    -   fort-collins-curb-events-trip_ends.csv

-   City of Fort Collins Website

    -   scooters-analyze-trips-by-date.csv

    -   fortcollins-routs-data-for-scooter-in-all-time.csv

## Building off the Research Question

Predicting Future Rides Without Price Point 3

![](Model%20Photos/hehemeep.png){fig-align="center" width="284"}

The data for the actual number of rides ends October 17th 2024, so there isn't a lot to compare.

## Building off the Research Question

Matched Rides Per Price Period

![](Model%20Photos/longboy.png){fig-align="center"}

The graphs contain normalized data of roads/line segments in Fort Collins and the count of matched trips taken over that price period.

Wanted to examine this further, but ran into problems.

## Mapping KNN Model Predictions

Models were fit under a 20 fold cross validation. Both models selected an epanechnikov kernel and best k = 15. The Deployment KNN model reported an MSE of 0.04891901 and the Start KNN model reported an MSE of 0. 04380498.

## Moving Forward

-   Create meaningful discount zone boundaries & forecast
-   Geographical data Inaccuracies & data collection
-   Present information to SPIN
